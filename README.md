As a part of our experience at Kode with Klossy, my peers and I collaborated on programming a resource hub 
for women and nonbinary individuals that have been sexually assaulted. We incorporated books, helplines, 
organizations, a journal-styled “Rant Chat,” and other features designed for those who have trauma from 
sexual harm. My focus was on user interface design using Figma and CSS and on Javascript functionalities.
